#Human or Machine? Detecting Text Generation Origins with Predictive Models

Project for Statistical Machine Learning COMP90051

Throughout the project, we developed predictive models to discern between human-generated and machine-generated text, with performance evaluated based on prediction accuracy and a detailed solution report.

- final_notebook calls scripts to run data loading, preprocessing and data exploration
- TFIDF preprocessing notebook performs further preprocessing used for domain 2 model
- ANN notebook runs domain 2 model
- SVM notebook runs secondary approach domain 2 model
- Naive bayes notebook runs secondary approach domain 2 model
- RNN notebook runs domain 1 model
